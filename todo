            How to get the blog detail:
                    for every link we add an argument to the url like this {% url 'blog-detail' ${post.blog_id} %}
                    in our django view we return a context which will be a blog id used to get the blog details...

        if yes then he can comment
    work on comment
    create a delete and update button
    create a update page -- has to do with forms

go back to the index page and work on the getting posts based on categories
work on the search feature
